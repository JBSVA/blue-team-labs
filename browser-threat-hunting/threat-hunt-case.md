# Browser-Based Threat Hunting Investigation

## Introduction
This investigation simulates a SOC analyst performing browser-based threat hunting and indicator enrichment following suspicious activity observed in the environment. The objective is to assess the risk of identified indicators using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and determine appropriate security actions.

---

## Scope
The investigation focuses on analyzing a small set of indicators of compromise (IOCs), including domains, IP addresses, and URLs, using publicly available threat intelligence platforms.

---

## Indicators Investigated
| Indicator | Type | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
|          |      |        |
|          |      |        |
|          |      |        |

---

## Investigation Methodology
Each indicator was analyzed using multiple OSINT tools to assess reputation, activity history, and associations with known malicious campaigns.

Tools used:
- VirusTotal  
- AbuseIPDB  
- URLScan  
- WHOIS / DNS lookup tools  

---

## Findings

### Indicator 1
**Indicator:**  
**Type:**  

**Analysis:**
- VirusTotal:
- AbuseIPDB:
- URLScan:
- WHOIS / DNS:

**Assessment:**  
(Malicious / Suspicious / Benign)

---

## Conclusions
Based on OSINT enrichment and correlation, the investigated indicators were assessed for maliciousness and risk to the environment.

---

## Recommended Actions
- Block confirmed malicious indicators at network and email gateways
- Monitor suspicious indicators for further activity
- No action required for confirmed benign indicators
- Document findings for future reference and detection tuning
