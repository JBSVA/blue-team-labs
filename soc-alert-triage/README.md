# SOC Alert Triage Simulation

This project simulates the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst performing alert triage using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. The investigation focuses on validating alerts, analyzing supporting evidence, and determining whether escalation or remediation is required.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate practical alert-handling skills expected of an entry-level SOC analyst (L1)
- Distinguish true security incidents from false positives using contextual analysis
- Document findings, verdicts, and recommended actions in a clear, professional format
- Follow standard SOC workflows, including prioritization and escalation procedures

## Key Activities
- Investigated multiple SIEM alerts of varying severity, including suspected malware activity, potential data exfiltration, and routine external downloads
- Analyzed host, user, and network context to validate alert accuracy
- Recorded investigation steps, verdict rationale, and outcomes for each alert

## Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM alert prioritization and triage
- Endpoint and network activity analysis
- Identification and handling of false positives
- Incident documentation and audit-ready reporting
- Escalation decision-making within SOC workflows
